# Introduction

Welcome to my home table ttrpg rules I'm dubbing: The Radiant Hack. This game is a traditional tabletop role-playing game, played with paper, pencils and dice. 

## What is this game?
The Radiant Hack is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG): a game where ***Players*** assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting, guided by a set of rules and a game master (***GM***) who narrates the story and oversees gameplay.

## How does it work?
***Players*** describe their characters' actions, and the outcomes are often determined by rolling dice and using stats.

The imaginary world that the ***Players*** will explore is populated by a cast of ***Creatures***. The rules define ***Creatures*** as being one of the two following types: 
- ***Characters*** controlled by the ***Players***.
- ***Non-Player Characters (NPCs)*** and ***Monsters*** that are created and controlled by the ***GM***.

The ***Playersâ€™*** roles in the game are straightforward but not necessarily easy! They will be presented with a scene in which they describe in ***Turn*** what their ***Characters*** do, rolling dice to determine the outcome of their ***Actions***.
