# Getting Started

## The core mechanic

Everything a ***Character*** might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll **below** it on a d20.

Monsters don’t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time a monster would roll is for damage.

## Creating your character
### Concept
The first step to creating a memorable ***Character*** is coming up with an engaging ‘concept’. In your mind, think of one sentence that summarises who the ***Character*** is, and what might make them interesting to play.

Examples:
- A magician who seeks after new magic
- A smooth talking trickster
- A wandering mercenary
- A gambler in a great deal of debt

### Attributes
Every ***Character*** has 6 ***Attributes*** that define them. They define everything about the ***Character*** - how strong, dexterous, resilient, intelligent, wise, and charismatic they are. 
- Take 3d6 (3 six sided dice) and roll them, adding them together. Do this for each of the ***Attributes*** below in order writing the results in pencil, next to the Attributes on a Character sheet.
-  If you roll 14+, don’t roll dice for the next Attribute - instead it will be 7. Roll again as per normal after this.
  
|            Strength (STR)            |              Dexterity (DEX)               |         Constitution (CON)         |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| physical power and **Melee Attacks** | Swiftness, agility, and **Ranged Attacks** | Resiliance and physical well being |

|             Intelligence (INT)              |                Wisdom (WIS)                 |             Charisma (CHA)             |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| Knowledge, judgement, and **Arcane Spells** | Cunning, perception, and **Divine Prayers** | Influence and the power of personality |

You may swap 2 ***Attributes*** around if that would better fit your ***Character*** idea

## Choose a class
Each class will also determine how much damage a starting ***Character*** can take - measured in Hit Points, also what armour they can use, damage they deal when they Attack, and what they gain as they advance in Levels. Choosing a class also determines your starting equipment and coins.
