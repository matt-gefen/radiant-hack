# Getting Started

## The core mechanic

Everything a ***Character*** might possibly attempt that could result in failure is resolved by testing attribute stats, in order to successfully test a stat - a player must roll **below** it on a d20.

Monsters don’t make tests - a character must avoid their attacks by making a test, the only time a monster would roll is for damage.

## Creating your character
### Concept
The first step to creating a memorable ***Character*** is coming up with an engaging ‘concept’. In your mind, think of one sentence that summarises who the ***Character*** is, and what might make them interesting to play.

Examples:
- A magician who seeks after new magic
- A smooth talking trickster
- A wandering mercenary
- A gambler in a great deal of debt

### Attributes
Every ***Character*** has 6 ***Attributes*** that define them. They define everything about the ***Character*** - how strong, dexterous, resilient, intelligent, wise, and charismatic they are. 
- Take 3d6 (3 six sided dice) and roll them, adding them together. Do this for each of the ***Attributes*** below in order writing the results in pencil, next to the Attributes on a Character sheet.
-  If you roll 14+, don’t roll dice for the next Attribute - instead it will be 7. Roll again as per normal after this.

***Strength (STR):*** physical power and **Melee Attacks**
***Dexterity (DEX):*** Swiftness, agility, and **Ranged Attacks**
***Constitution (CON):*** Resiliance and physical well being
***Intelligence (INT):*** Knowledge, judgement, and **Arcane Spells**
***Wisdom (WIS):*** Cunning, perception, and **Divine Prayers**
***Charisma (CHA):*** Influence and the power of personality

You may swap 2 ***Attributes*** around if that would better fit your ***Character*** idea

Next you will [choose a class](/character/classes) for your ***Character***
