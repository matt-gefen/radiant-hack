# Core Rules



## Players turn

During a player’s turn a character may move and perform an action. They could attack, look for a clue, talk with an NPC, cast a spell - interacting with the world is an action. Often they will test their attributes to determine the outcome.

## Time & turns

There are 2 important types of tracked time 
- **Moments** (*rounds*) and **Minutes** (*turns*). 

**Moments** are used during combat and fast paced scenes of danger and **Minutes** are used when exploring and adventuring. A GM may advance the clock as they need substituting **Minutes** for **Hours**, **Days** or even **Months** should the adventure require it.

## Movement & distance

Rather than track precise numbers, we use 4 abstract ranges for measuring distances. **Close**, **Nearby**, **Far-Away** and **Distant**. On their turn every character can move somewhere **Nearby** as part of an action, performing that action at any stage of the move. They can forgo their action and move somewhere **Far-Away** instead. Anything beyond **Far-Away** can be classified as **Distant** and would take 3 moves to get to.

This system is designed to support the narrative ‘theatre of the mind’ style of play, and is less concerned about tracking squares and fiddly distances. For converting existing movement rates or measures (for spells or areas of effect) use the following as a guide :

|  CLOSE  |  NEARBY  |  FAR AWAY  |
|:-------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| 0 - 5ft (1 square) | 5 - 60ft (6 squares) | 60 - 120ft (12 squares) |

## Advantage & disadvantage

A GM may decide that a particular course of action or task has a higher or lower chance of success. They will ask a player to roll an additional d20 when making a test - with **advantage** the lower result is used and with **disadvantage**, the higher.
