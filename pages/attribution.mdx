## References
This game is mostly based on The Black Hack by David Black as well as Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). I will be mixing and matching some concepts from these games as well as:
- Cairn
- Block, Dodge, Parry
- Old School Essentials
- DURF

This is for personal use at my table and not intended for commercial use as of now
